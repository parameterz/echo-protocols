## Intro
<article>
The assessment of AS is all about careful attention to the LVOT diameter (area) and seeking the highest velocity (PEDOF RSB!)

## CW Doppler 

- CW Doppler of the aortic valve (AoV) from the apical windows is mandatory. Must use PEDOF probe from the apicals, SSN and RSB windows for all AS/AVR/TAVR patients.
- Acquire and label PEDOF with location
- If a signal is unobtainable, annotate, “Location Attempt,” e.g., “SSN Attempt.”


## PW Doppler 

- Place PW Doppler sample volume below the aortic valve annulus, with a hint of the aortic valve closure click

## Peak and mean gradients

- If LVOT velocity is > 1.5m/s, use the extended modified Bernoulli formula 4(V2² - V1²) for peak/mean gradients

## LVOT diameter

- For <mark>native AoV</mark>, measure LVOT diameter basically at the aortic annulus. 
- OK to use the previous LVOT diameter measurement to be consistent, unless the previous measurement was incorrect. 
- For <mark>prosthetic AVR</mark>, measure “LVOT” diameter from outer prosthesis to outer prosthesis (leading edge to trailing edge). 

## Dimensionless Index

- Calculate and report Dimensionless Index as LVOT VTI/AoV VTI 

## Continuity Equation

- Calculate and report Continuity Equation derived aortic valve area (AVA) as well as indexed area for all patients

## Fallback: Planimetry <i class="fa-solid fa-dumpster-fire"></i>

- If AVA is unobtainable due to inadequate CW Doppler of the AoV, trace the AoV area by 2D planimetry from PSAX or by using 3D guidance. 
- Report as “AVA is ____ cm2 by 2D trace

## BAV

- If the AoV is bicuspid, check for associated AAO dilation or coarctation

## LFLG AS

- Low flow (SVi < 35 ml/m2>) and low gradient (gradient < 40 mmHg>) but with an AVA of < 1.0 cm2
- Comes in 2 flavors:
  - Classical, with reduced EF
  - Paradoxical: with normal  EF (&gt; 50%)

## Flow Rate

- Trans-aortic flow rate (SV &div; ejection time) of less than 210 ml/sec (sometimes quoted as 250) is considered _low flow_.
