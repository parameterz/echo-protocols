## Intro
1. 2 beat capture (include <mark>3 or more if AFIB</mark>/rapid rhythm)
2. Doppler measurements with time component need to be measured at 100 mm/sec.
3. ALL Doppler imaging (CW & PW) should be captured <mark>without a measurement(1st)</mark> and with (2nd) a measurement.
4. Zoomed images should only be additional images
5. Measurements to be taken are in italics and should be done during the exam in the order described
6. This protocol is minimum standard for a normal patient and must be adjusted to each patient’s findings
