## Intro
- In addition to Adult Echo standard protocol, the following should be performed...

## CW Doppler 

- CW Doppler of the aortic valve (AoV) from the apical windows is mandatory. Must use PEDOF probe from the apicals, SSN and RSB windows for all AS/AVR/TAVR patients.
- Acquire and label PEDOF with location
- If a signal is unobtainable, annotate, “Location Attempt,” e.g., “SSN Attempt.”
- Position patient as follows: Apical – patient in left lateral decubitus position; SSN – patient lying supine with head hyperextended; RSB – patient in right lateral decubitus position

## PW Doppler 

- Place PW Doppler sample volume 0.5-1.0 cm below the aortic valve annulus
- For commercial TAVRs and AVR, place PW Doppler sample volume below and outside, and not within the prosthetic valve stent
- For Research TAVRs, place PW Doppler sample volume both outside the stent as well as inside the stent, but below the leaflets
- Trace PW Doppler LVOT signal for VTI

## Peak and mean gradients

- Measure and report peak and mean pressure gradients
- If LVOT velocity is > 1.5m/s, use the extended modified Bernoulli formula 4(V2² - V1²) for peak/mean gradients
- Choose the dropdowns “AoV (corrected) peak PG” and “AoV (corrected) mean PG.” 
- Report as “Peak/mean gradients are ____ when corrected for increased LVOT velocity.”

## LVOT diameter

- Measure the LVOT diameter
- For <mark>native AoV</mark>, measure LVOT diameter approximately 5mm from the aortic annulus. 
- Use “Trending chart” feature on ISCV, and try to use the previous LVOT diameter measurement to be consistent, unless the previous measurement was incorrect. 
- For <mark>prosthetic AVR</mark>, measure “LVOT” diameter from outer prosthesis to outer prosthesis (leading edge to trailing edge). 
- Use “Trending chart” feature on ISCV and try to make your LVOT measurement the same as the previous LVOT measurement unless the previous measurement was incorrect. If LVOT/prosthesis is not clearly seen, (use prior pre-op LVOT diameter as reference), Using a new LVOT diameter that deviates from pre-op diameter is perfectly acceptable but subsequent studies should all use the same new (bigger) post-op LVOT diameter. Prosthetic AVR manufacturer’s size may be a starting point for direct measurements i.e., 21mm AVR may have “LVOT” diameter around 2.1 cm. Always measure the LVOT diameter. Keep in mind that the LVOT diameter is a big source of error since it is squared in the continuity equation, and may be the reason why a valve area does not match up with pressure gradients and dimensionless index.

## Dimensionless Index

- Calculate and report Dimensionless Index as LVOT VTI/AoV VTI (number will likely be <1)

## Continuity Equation

- Calculate and report Continuity Equation derived aortic valve area (AVA) as well as indexed area for all patients

## Fallback: Planimetry <i class="fa-solid fa-dumpster-fire"></i>

- If AVA is unobtainable due to inadequate CW Doppler of the AoV, trace the AoV area by 2D planimetry from PSAX or by using 3D guidance. Report as “AVA is ____ cm2 by 2D trace

## BAV

- If the AoV is bicuspid, check for associated aortic coarctation from the SSN view
