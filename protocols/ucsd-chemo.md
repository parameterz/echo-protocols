## Intro

- Goals are to image the following:
  - Global LV systolic function
    - EF!
    - 3D !
    - Low threshold for using UEAs
  - Strain
  - Diastolic function

## PLAX

- 2-D image PLAX at regular depth
- Linear measurements in diastole:
  - IVSd :meas:
  - LVIDd :meas:
  - LVPWd :meas:
- Linear measurements in systole (MV & AOV _closed)_:
  - LVIDs :meas:
- _Conspicuously absent from this protocol: Color flow_

## PSAX

- 2-D of the mid-papillary muscle level

## A4C

- 2-D image of A4C optimizing LV endocardial borders and LV length

## A4C - LV Focused

- 2-D image of A4C optimizing LV endocardial borders and LV length
- LVEDV :meas:
- LVESV :meas:
- 3D Full Volume Acquisition and Analysis
  - Reporting of 3-D EF should be done if the software is tracking the endocardium reasonably well

## A2C - LV Focused

- 2-D image of A2C optimizing LV endocardial borders and LV length
- LVEDV :meas:
- LVESV :meas:

## A3C - LV Focused

- 2-D image of A4C optimizing LV endocardial borders and LV length

## A4C

- _Conspicuously absent from this protocol: Color of MV, PVns, PVn Doppler_
- Pulsed wave (PW) Doppler of MV inflow leaflet tips showing E and A velocity and slope (minimum <mark>50 mm/sec sweep speed</mark>)
- Pulsed wave (PW) Doppler of MV inflow leaflet tips showing E and A velocity and slope (minimum <mark>100 mm/sec sweep speed</mark>)
  - Peak E velocity :meas:
  - E decel time :meas:
  - Peak A velocity :meas:
- Tissue Doppler of MV annulus – lateral – optimize for e’ and a’ :meas:
- Tissue Doppler of MV annulus – septal – optimize for e’ and a’ :meas:
- Color Doppler covering TV and RA for tricuspid regurgitation
- Continuous wave (CW) Doppler of TR jet
  - TR Peak Velocity :meas:

## SubC

- 4 chamber view
- IVC (5 beat loop to show inspiration/collapse)
- IVC Diameter :meas:

## Strain (EPSILON off cart)  

- 4C, 2C, 3C for GLS
- LA strain for bonus
