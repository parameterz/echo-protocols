## Intro

- These are a combination of points from a Summer 2024 educational presentation and my personal notes.

## General Notes

- Ideally, the <mark>order</mark> for UEAs is put in before you get it from the PYXIS
- <i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Important: screen for <mark>allergies & contraindications</mark>
  - perflutren (the inert gas in the microbubble)
  - previous reaction
  - PEG (polyethelene glycol)
  - pregnancy
  - blood, blood products, human albumin (Optison)
- Unless looking specifically at the apex (thrombus?), the <mark>focus</mark> should be deep
- obtain images:
  - A4C
  - A2C
  - A3C
  - PLAX
  - PSAX
  - Boutique views for RV, RVOT 
  - TR Doppler
- Note the following details for later documentation:
  - time IV placed
  - catheter size
  - time IV removed

## Definity: Prep

- Theare are 2 VialMixers: 
  - workroom 
  - clean utility
- empty 1.3 cc from a 10cc saline syringe (syringe should now have 8.ml saline) and draw up 1.3 ml from the activated Definity bottle
- mix gently
- hold syringe upright, tap, and expell any air
- connect Definity/saline preparation to IV 
- inject 1-2 ml slowly over 10-20 seconds
- additional small doses (0.5 ml) can be given slowly as needed


- UCSD-specific recommendations for Definity administration:
  - Remove 0.5mL from 10ml normal saline flush syringe
  - Add 0.5 mL of activated Definity® to the normal saline flush syringe
  - Draw up 2 syringes following steps 1-2
  - Administer 1 mL SLOWLY, at a rate of 1mL/10 sec
  - May re-dose every 30 seconds to effect*, up to 20 diluted 1 mL doses (2 mL of Definity®)
  - Maintain activation of agent by rolling syringe every 5 minutes

  - *Dose to effect is defined as having bright homogenous contrast throughout left ventricular cavity without swirling and slight 
  attenuation at mitral valve annulus on the echocardiogram


## Definity: Settings

- Philips
  - Use the Contrast setting: LVO
  - MI should be <mark>0.16</mark>-ish
  - Optimize the <mark>frequency</mark> (usually as low as it goes; watch the MI!)
  - Persistence: MED
  - Focus: usually at MV annulus unless specifically looking at apex (watch the MI!)

- GE
  - details needed

## Optison: Prep

- Maintain homogeneous, opaque, milky-white suspension by rolling vial between palms prior to drawing up dose
- Draw up entire 3ml vial of Optison™ in syringe, taking care not to inject air into the vial
- Set up Optison™ syringe, normal saline flush and 3-way stopcock
- Administer bolus dose of 0.3ml of Optison™ SLOWLY, followed by 2 ml normal saline flush
- May repeat 0.3ml and 2ml, dose to effect*
- <mark>Not to exceed 5ml in 10 minutes</mark> and MAX 10 doses

- Dose to effect is defined as having bright homogenous contrast throughout 
  left ventricular cavity without swirling and slight attenuation 
  at mitral valve annulus on the echocardiogram
