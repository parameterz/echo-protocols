## Intro
1. ACHD Echoes are to be performed by credentialed personnel (RDCS, RCCS, RCS, or ACS) who have gone through CHD training.
2. ACHD Echo cannot be performed without an ACHD Echo order.
3. If ACHD Echo was erroneously ordered as an Adult Echo, have the provider place an ACHD Echo order prior to performing the Echo.
4. If an Adult Echo has unexpected findings of congenital heart defect (CHD), perform an ACHD Echo per protocol below and have the provider place an ACHD Echo order. The ACHD Echo study will need to be linked to the correct ACHD Echo order prior to the report being finalized by the physician.
5. Notify the reading physician when an inpatient ACHD Echo has been performed and is ready to be read.
6. All outpatient (OP) and inpatient (IP) ACHD Echoes must be assigned to an ACHD reading physician.
7. Charges/billing for a full ACHD Echo are CPT code 93303 Echo Congenital Complete, 93325 Color Doppler, 93320 Doppler Complete, and 93356 Myocardial Strain. Do not bill for 93319 3D Echo rendering for CHD, even if it was done.
8. A complete ACHD Echo will utilize the following modalities: two-dimensional Echo (2D), color Doppler (color), pulse wave spectral Doppler (PW Doppler), continuous wave spectral Doppler (CW Doppler), three dimensional Echo (3D), and myocardial strain (strain).

## Guideline
1. Patient’s height, weight, and blood pressure must be recorded on Echo report.
2. Patients with history of coarctation of the aorta (COA) should have blood pressures recorded from all four limbs on Echo report.
3. All 2D and color images are loops with minimum consecutive 2 beat capture. All measurements are freeze frame. Doppler images are freeze frame and should be accompanied by measurements. Sweeps are consecutive multiple beat capture of cardiac structures while the ultrasound beam is moved.
4. Doppler measurements with time component should be measured at 100 mm/sec minimum.
5. Images should be captured in full screen mode. Images captured using zoom feature should be additional images. Color compare, bi-plane, sweeps, and 3D imaging can be beneficial on certain anatomy and should be captured as additional images.
6. Perform and report left ventricle (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) and right ventricle (RV) longitudinal free wall strain on **all patients** where possible.
7. Perform and report 3D derived LV ejection fraction where possible.
8. All new patients at UCSD will get a full ACHD Echo regardless if they have had a full Echo at an outside healthcare institution. A full ACHD Echo will include assessment of the following anatomy:
   - Major systemic veins including inferior vena cava (IVC), superior vena cava (SVC), innominate vein, hepatic vein, coronary sinus (CS)
   - Atria including left atrium (LA), right atrium (RA), common atrium
   - Interatrial atrial septum (IAS)
   - Atrioventricular (AV) valve(s) including mitral valve (MV), tricuspid valve (TV), left atrioventricular valve (LAVV), right atrioventricular valve (RAVV), and common atrioventricular (CAVV) valve
   - Ventricle(s) including LV, RV, single ventricle (SV)
   - Interventricular septum (IVS)
   - Outflow(s) including left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), sub aortic, right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), and sub pulmonic
   - Semilunar valve(s) including aortic valve (AoV), pulmonic valve (PV), neo aortic valve, neo pulmonic valve, truncal valve
   - Coronary artery origins of left and right coronaries
   - Aortic annulus, aortic sinus of Valsalva (AoR), sinotubular junction (STJ), ascending aorta (AAo)
   - Aortic arch and sidedness, first brachiocephalic artery (1st BCA), distal transverse arch (dTAo), aortic isthmus
   - Aortic arch branches including left and right carotid arteries (LCCA, RCCA) and left and right subclavian arteries (LSCA, RSCA)
   - Main pulmonary artery (MPA). Right pulmonary artery (RPA), left pulmonary artery (LPA), and central pulmonary artery (CPA) - collectively called branch pulmonary arteries (BPA)
   - Patches, baffles, devices, grafts, stents, and conduits
9. Sweeps can be very helpful in determining anatomical relationships, following a structure, as well as interrogating a large structure.
10. If patient is &le; 25 years old, use pediatric (Z score) standards for the aortic series (annulus, AoR, STJ, AAo, distal arch, isthmus). If patient is > 25 years old use adult (ASE) measurement standards for the aortic series. Sometimes it may be necessary to apply both standards such as when a patient’s prior abnormal measurements were done using pediatric standards and serial measurement comparison is needed.
11. The protocol may begin with standard parasternal long axis (PLAX) images, or from subcostal images “segmental approach.”
12. Proceed in an orderly manner with 2D imaging, followed by color Doppler of that same view, and any spectral Doppler, M-mode, zoom, X-plane, or 3D needed of that same view.
13. Annotations/labels can be necessary to inform the reader of your probe movements i.e. “Sweep Left,” or to alert the reader to specific anatomy.
14. “Follow the flow” may be a better way to image some complex anatomical arrangements (anything other than {S,D,S}). For example, image left inflow then left outflow, then image right inflow then right outflow. To this end, deviations from the protocol sequence, described below, may be necessary to “follow the flow.” For example, in DILV, image both inlets then image the outlets.
15. The below protocol is minimum imaging standard for ACHD Echo and must be adjusted to each patient’s findings (see disease specific add on for guidance).
